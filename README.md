## TODO:

### Firmware Tasks
* Analyze peaks in accelerometer wakeup - transmission cycle
* Continuous voltage sampling or voltage wakeup with SAADC/LPCOMP
    * See if connection is dropped in power mode + recovery time/power
    * See if slave latency can be increased

### Hardware Tasks
* Test plan for signal generator power input
    * Amplifier possibly needed
* Strip/profile stepper voltage
    * How to simulate coupled inductive load?
